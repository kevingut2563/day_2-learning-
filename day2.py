# # Description: This file is for the second day of the python workshop


# # create variables for the following :
# # 1. age
# age = "16"
# # 2. name
# name = "Kevin" 
# # 3. song
# song = "todo de ti"
# # 4. food
# food = "pizza"
# # 5. number
# number = 50
# # #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
# print(f'''Once upon a time, there was a {age} old coder {name}. {name} liked to hum the song {song} while coding.

# # Syntax is a way of writing code that

# # What is syntax ? What is an algorithm?
# # what is a variable? What is a string?

# # strings are nothing but plain text
# # what does this do?
# print("Giraffe \n academy")
# #/n makes a new line 
# print("giraffe \t academy")
# #\t makes a tab

# # or this
# phrase = "python learning"

print(new_Phrase.lower())
#.lower is a method that makes the string all lower case

#what if I wanted to check and see if the phrase was all lower or upper?

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase
# letter eye) as single character variable names.



# Working with numbers bold text
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Addition
print(2+2)
# Subtraction
print(2-5)
# Multiplication
print(2*3)
# Division
print(10/2)
# Modulus
print(10%3)
# Exponentiation
print(2**3)
# Floor Division
print(10//3)
# Order of Operations followed in Python
print(2*3+1)
# You can use parentheses to specify the order in which you want operations to be performed.

#to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
#from math import *
#this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
#floor method
#ceil method
#sqrt method
from math import * #import everything
print(floor(95.76666))
print(ceil(98.3333))
print(sqrt(54))


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers. Integers are just whole numbers,
# positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or
# use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of
# floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating
# point number in Python.



# challenge exerces... 
#create a program that asks for the user's name and age and then prints out the user's name and age

# create a program that asks for the user's name and then prints out the user's name in all caps

# create a program that asks for the user's name and then prints out the user's name in all lower case

# Given the phrase "Hancock High School", perform the following operations:
# Print the phrase with a newline character to separate "Hancock" and "High" and "School".
# Concatenate the phrase with " is cool", and print the result.
# Print the length of the phrase.
# Convert and print the phrase in uppercase and lowercase.
# Check if the phrase is all lower or all upper and print the result.
# Print the first and the last letter of the phrase.
